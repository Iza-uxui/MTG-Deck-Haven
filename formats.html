            <h3>Standard</h3>
            <p>Standard is one of the most accessible formats for new players. It uses cards from the most recent Magic sets—usually the past few years—so the card pool is smaller and easier to learn. Decks are built with a minimum of 60 cards, and players can use up to four copies of most cards. Because the format changes as new sets release, it stays fresh and balanced.</p>

                <h3>Commander (EDH)</h3>
                <p>Commander is a casual, multiplayer format where each player builds a 100-card deck led by a legendary creature (called a Commander). You can only have one copy of each card (except basic lands), and your Commander shapes your deck’s colors and strategy. It’s known for being social, creative, and full of big, memorable plays.</p>

              <div>
                <h3>Modern</h3>
                <p>Modern allows cards from sets going back to 2003 (Eighth Edition and later). The larger card pool offers tons of strategies—from fast combo decks to slow, controlling builds. It’s great for players who enjoy deep strategy and long-term deckbuilding without constant rotation.</p>

            <p><strong>Note: </strong>There are many great ways to play MTG. It all comes down to finding the format you enjoy the most. Find something that you're excited about, ask local players what their favorite format is, or gain inspiration from content creators.</p>

            <h3>Booster Draft</h3>
            <p>In a Draft, players open booster packs together and take turns choosing cards (called “drafting”) to build a 40-card deck on the spot. Drafting tests both your card evaluation and deckbuilding skills, making it one of the most exciting ways to learn how different cards interact.</p>

            <h3>Sealed Deck</h3>
            <p>In Sealed, each player opens a set number of booster packs (usually six) and builds a 40-card deck from only those cards. It’s a great way to experience a new set, since everyone starts with random cards and has to make the best deck they can from what they open.</p>
